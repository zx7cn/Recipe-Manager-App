# My Personal Project

## A recipe manager application
This application will help users to manage their recipe collections by adding, viewing, removing recipes. Some 
recommandations of recipes will also be given to users depending on what particular ingredient they have. 

The intended audience is anyone who cooks or love food.
I'm interested in this project because I am a big fan of cooking and I would like to have an application to help me 
manage recipes.

##User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a recipe to my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to select a recipe and view it in detail
- As a user, I want to be able to scale recipes if I want to cook more or less servings
- As a user, I want to be able to view the recipes which use the particular ingredient I have in my fridge
